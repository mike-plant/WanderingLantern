## Cleveland's First Dedicated Children's Bookstore Opens in Lakewood

**Lakewood, OH** – November 29, 2025 – The Wandering Lantern, Cleveland's first dedicated children's bookstore, will officially open its doors at 15729 Madison Avenue in Lakewood. The store marks a significant addition to Cleveland's independent bookstore scene, offering a curated selection of children's literature in a magical, welcoming environment.

Founded by Emily Mitchell, a former educator with a Master's in English Literature, and Michael Plant, a local realtor and small business advocate, The Wandering Lantern aims to become a community gathering place where families can discover quality children's books and participate in literary events.

"There hasn't been a dedicated children's bookstore in Cleveland, and we saw an opportunity to create something truly special," says Mitchell. "Every book in our store is handpicked to inspire wonder, creativity, and a love of reading."

The 1,500-square-foot store features cozy reading nooks, carefully curated book collections for ages 0-14, and a dedicated event space for storytimes and author visits. The store will host regular programming including weekly story hours, seasonal celebrations, and visits from local and nationally recognized children's book authors.

"Thriving neighborhoods need gathering places where people connect," adds Plant. "We're committed to making The Wandering Lantern a welcoming space for Lakewood families and the broader Cleveland community."

The Wandering Lantern joins Lakewood's vibrant Madison Avenue business district, contributing to the area's growing reputation as a destination for independent retail and dining.

The grand opening celebration on November 29 will feature extended hours, special promotions, and activities for young readers. The store will be open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 AM to 6 PM, with extended hours on Thursdays until 8 PM.
