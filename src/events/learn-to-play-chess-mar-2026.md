## About This Event

Come hang out, learn some moves, and play some chess! This is a fun, relaxed afternoon for kids of all ages — whether you're just getting started or already know your way around the board. Parents, use your best judgment on whether your little one is ready to join in!

We'll kick things off with a quick intro to the game, then open things up to just play, hang out, and enjoy. For the more experienced players, we'll also have a little tournament with prizes!

### What's Happening
