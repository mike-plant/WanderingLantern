## About This Event

There's something magical about getting a handwritten letter in the mail. Join us for **Postcard Pen Pals** — an evening of designing, creating, and connecting through the lost art of the handwritten postcard.

You'll spend the evening crafting a whole stack of postcards — drawing, coloring, and decorating them however you like. Then at the end of the night, we'll pair everyone up with a pen pal and get your first postcard on its way. From there, it's up to you to keep the letters going!

### What You'll Do

- **Design and decorate** a stack of postcards with your own artwork, colors, and style
- **Write your first postcard** to your new pen pal before the night is over
- **Get matched** with a pen pal your age to keep the correspondence going
- **Take home extra postcards** ready to fill and send

### For Parents

This is a wonderful event for kids and parents to enjoy together — or a great drop-off activity for older kids. Either way, everyone goes home with a pen pal and a reason to get excited about the mail!

### Cost

**$12 per person** — includes all materials: blank postcards, stamps, art supplies, and your first mailing.

### Details

Open to all ages. Space is limited, so grab your spot early!
