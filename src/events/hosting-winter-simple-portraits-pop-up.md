We’re excited to host **A Little Bit Perfect** at The Wandering Lantern for a winter portrait pop-up.

These are simple, timeless portraits focused on connection. Natural light, soft styling, and a calm pace that lets kids and families be themselves. Perfect for updating family photos, capturing this season, or getting ahead on gifts without the stress of a full photo session.

Sessions take place right here in the warmth of the shop, with a relaxed, welcoming vibe. Feel free to arrive early or linger after your session to browse books and enjoy the space.

**Note:**
All session details, pricing, and scheduling are handled directly by A Little Bit Perfect. Registration is required in advance.
