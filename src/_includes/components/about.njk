        The Wandering Lantern is a community bookstore created by Emily and Michael, two book lovers who wanted to bring
        something special to Lakewood.

        <strong>Emily Mitchell</strong> is the heart of our book curation. With a Master's in English Literature and a background in
        teaching, she has a genuine love for children's stories and helping young readers discover books they'll treasure.
        As a mom of four and former homeschool educator, she knows firsthand how the right book at the right time can make
        all the difference.

        <strong>Michael Plant</strong> is a local realtor and small business owner who believes thriving neighborhoods need gathering
        places where people connect. He brings business operations and community relationships to the table, working to make
        The Wandering Lantern a welcoming space for Lakewood families.

        Together, we're building Cleveland's first dedicated children's bookstore—a place where stories come alive and
        families can explore, discover, and connect.
