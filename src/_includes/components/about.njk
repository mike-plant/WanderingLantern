    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Cleveland has great bookstores, but no place dedicated entirely to children's books. We wanted to change that. The Wandering Lantern
        is a neighborhood bookstore where families can browse together, where kids can discover their next favorite story, and where reading
        feels like an adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
        We picked Lakewood because the community just gets it. People walk to the library and the park here. Neighbors actually know each other.
        When we found this corner location across from the park and walking distance from the middle school, it felt right.

    <p>
        Emily's earliest reading memory is lying on a metal futon bunk bed with pink and green sponge-painted walls, listening to her mom
        read <em>Little House in the Big Woods</em>. She fell in love with literature in Mr. Fry's 11th grade class at WRA, where books
        like <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> and <em>The Invisible Man</em> stopped being assignments and became something she couldn't put down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Children's literature came later, when she had four kids and started building a home library for them. Trips to the bookstore became
        the highlight of the week. She homeschooled for years, and her favorite memories are the read-aloud sessions: <em>Henry Huggins</em>,
        all seven <em>Harry Potter</em> books, <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>. Emily has a Master's in English Literature, and she brings
        both book nerd expertise and mom-who's-read-a-thousand-bedtime-stories instinct to curating what goes on our shelves.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; color: var(--deep-green);">Michael Plant</h3>
    <p>
        Michael grew up reading fantasy and adventure—books about made-up creatures and magical worlds, <em>Call of the Wild</em> with its
        Alaskan wilderness and sled dogs, space and science books that made him wonder about colonizing Mars. He wrote vivid short stories
        and reports about presidents. Books were his pathway to worlds beyond his own, a way to experience things he couldn't in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
        That curiosity led him through college philosophy and into reading across genres now—fantasy fiction, nonfiction, psychology. He loves
        military stories like <em>Extreme Ownership</em> for the edge-of-your-seat heroism, and he's been reading Brené Brown's work on
        authenticity. He recently rediscovered his childhood love of fantasy with dragons. He has kids and grandkids, and reading picture books
        to his grandson is one of his favorite things—even when the kid just flips back to the same page to say "mooo" over and over. Opening
        a children's bookstore connects his love of stories with his shift toward community-focused work, in a walkable Lakewood neighborhood
        where families know each other.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-weight: 500;">
        So here we are, building Cleveland's first dedicated children's bookstore. We're creating a place where the next generation
        discovers the books that will stick with them forever.
