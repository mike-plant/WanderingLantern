## 🎯 Tool #2: Modular Marketing Plan

**File:** `launch-dashboard/modular-plan.html`

### What It Is:
Every marketing initiative broken into independent modules. Each module can be KEPT or SKIPPED without affecting the others.

### How to Use It:
1. **Open in browser and print** (about 15 pages)
2. **Review each module** - read the description, time commitment, impact
3. **Mark KEEP or SKIP** for each module (there are buttons on each card)
4. **Focus only on KEEP modules** - forget the rest, no guilt

### The 10 Modules:
1. **Email Campaign** (5 emails) - MUST KEEP
2. **Instagram Daily Posting** - Highly recommended
3. **Press Outreach** - High impact, 3-4 hours
4. **Website Critical Fixes** - 3 must-do fixes, 1 hour total
5. **Pre-Order System** (Nov 21) - YOUR DECISION (5-8 hours)
6. **VIP Soft Opening** (Nov 28) - YOUR DECISION (7-9 hours)
7. **Grand Opening** (Nov 29) - MUST KEEP
8. **Community Partnerships** - SKIP for now, do after opening
9. **Paid Ads** ($150-300) - Optional if budget allows
10. **Website Enhancements** (FAQ, photos) - Nice to have, can do later

### Decision Matrix at the End:
- **Bare Minimum:** Modules 1, 7, 4 = 16-19 hours total
- **Recommended:** Add 2, 3, 6 = 40-50 hours total
- **Everything:** All modules = 65-80 hours total

### Best For:
- Understanding the full scope
- Making decisions about what to prioritize
- Removing things that feel like too much

## 📋 Tool #3: Progress Tracker (Print & Mark)

3. **Take a photo** with your phone when you want to update me

## How the Three Tools Work Together

### Example Weekly Workflow:

**Sunday Evening:**
1. Print **Week 2** from Fridge Calendar
2. Put it on fridge
3. Review what's coming this week

**During the Week:**
1. Check Fridge Calendar daily - "What's today's task?"
2. Check off tasks as you complete them
3. Add notes if something didn't work or you had questions

**Friday Planning Session:**
1. Review Fridge Calendar - what got done, what didn't?
2. Look at Progress Tracker - mark ✓ for completed items
3. If you skipped something, mark ✗ and add note why
4. Take photo of Progress Tracker
5. Send to Claude: "Week 2 update - here's what we did"
6. I'll respond with adjusted plan for Week 3

**Decision Points:**
- Use **Modular Marketing Plan** when you need to decide: "Should we do pre-orders?"
- Read that module, see time/impact, mark KEEP or SKIP
- Stick with decision, don't second-guess

---

## Printing Tips

### For Best Results:
- **Print in color** if possible (color-coding helps!)
- **Or print in black & white** - everything is readable without color
- **Standard letter size** (8.5" x 11") - all formatted for this
- **Print double-sided** if you want to save paper (but single-sided is easier for fridge)

### Suggested Printing:
- **Week 1 of Fridge Calendar:** Print NOW, put on fridge TODAY
- **Modular Marketing Plan:** Print all, read together, make decisions
- **Progress Tracker:** Print all, keep in a folder/binder for weekly marking

---

## Sending Updates Back to Claude

### What to Send:
- **Photos of marked-up Progress Tracker** (phone photos are fine!)
- **Quick message:** "Week 2 update" or "Finished press outreach" or "Skipping pre-orders, too much"

### What I'll Do:
- Update your plan based on reality
- Suggest adjustments if you're falling behind
- Celebrate wins when you're ahead!
- Create new tools if you need them (email drafts, social post templates, etc.)

### When to Update Me:
- **End of each week** (Friday or Sunday)
- **When you complete something big** (sent all press releases!)
- **When you get blocked** (can't figure out website image optimization)
- **When you change your mind** (decided to skip VIP opening)

## Key Reminders

### Done is Better Than Perfect
You don't need to do everything. Pick what matters most, do it well, skip the rest without guilt.

### Minimum Viable Opening:
If you're feeling overwhelmed, focus on:
1. **Email campaign** (your 100+ contacts are gold)
2. **Website image fix** (1 hour, huge performance gain)
3. **Grand opening Saturday** (the main event)
4. **Instagram 3x/week** (instead of daily)

That's it. Everything else is a bonus.

### You Have 25 Days:
- Nov 4 (today) → Nov 29 (grand opening)
- **Week 1 (Nov 4-10):** Build momentum
- **Week 2 (Nov 11-17):** Get the word out
- **Week 3 (Nov 18-24):** Final prep
- **Week 4 (Nov 25-29):** Opening week!

### Your Competitive Advantage:
1. Cleveland's FIRST & ONLY children's bookstore
2. Emily's expertise (teacher + mom of 4)
3. Opening on Small Business Saturday (perfect timing)
4. 100+ engaged email subscribers already
5. Beautiful storefront + curated selection

You've got this. Focus on what matters, execute consistently, and enjoy the journey.
