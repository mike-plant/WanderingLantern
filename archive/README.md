# Archived Files

This directory contains old files that have been replaced by the Eleventy migration.

## Contents

- **index.html** - Original single-page website (replaced by Eleventy templates)
- **email-signatures.html** - Email signature utility (kept for reference)
- **qr-code.html** - QR code generator utility (kept for reference)

## Why Archive?

These files are preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively used:

- The main website is now built from `src/` using Eleventy
- The built site is in `_site/`
- These HTML files are standalone utilities or replaced code

## Can I Delete These?

Yes, if you don't need them for reference. The new site doesn't depend on any files in this archive directory.

## Restoring Files

If you need to reference the original implementation, these files show the complete original HTML/CSS/JS before the Eleventy migration.
