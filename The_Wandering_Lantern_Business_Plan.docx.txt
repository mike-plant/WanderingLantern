Executive Summary
The Wandering Lantern is a children’s bookstore and community hub opening in Lakewood, OH. We’ll offer curated kids’/YA books, events (story hours, author visits, parties), and a warm, family-friendly space that blends retail with experience.
Funding request of $185,000
We are seeking $100,000 in SBA financing, to be combined with a $50,000 private loan, and $35,000 owner investment. Funds will cover a phased buildout ($50k starting October 2025 and $20k in January 2026, initial inventory ($17k), launch marketing ($12.5k), and a working-capital reserve to bridge the ramp to breakeven.
Why does this work here? Lakewood has ~26,569 households and a young median age (34.7), in a dense, highly walkable city (~70+ Walk Score citywide), supporting neighborhood retail. (Census Reporter) At the category level, the U.S. publishing market totaled $32.5B in 2024 and children’s/YA sales rose ~20% from 2020–2024—evidence of durable demand for kids’ books and programming. (AAP)

Roughly 5,700 of Lakewood’s households include children. Reaching just 20–25% of these households (≈1,100–1,400 families) at an average annual spend of $135 is sufficient to meet our Year 1 revenue projection of ~$150,000.
Operations & team. Buildout is staged to control cash. Inventory starts lean and replenishes from sales. Michael leads finance/ops/marketing; Emily leads curation and programs for families and schools.
Financial snapshot (from our model).
* Year 1: Revenue $150,303; Gross Profit $102,206; Net –$32,938 (deliberate, startup year).
* Breakeven: ~$28k/month sales by ~month 18.
* Debt service: projected DSCR ~1.4x in Year 2; reserves sized to cover Year-1 deficit and operating cushion.
* Owner commitment: $35,000 in equity value ($20k cash + $15k labor).

Community impact. The nearest large chain is in Westlake’s Crocker Park; other respected independents (Loganberry, Mac’s Backs, Visible Voice) are general-interest and outside Lakewood—leaving a clear gap for a dedicated children’s bookstore in our city. (Barnes & Noble Store Locator)

Business Overview
The Wandering Lantern is designed to be more than a bookstore. It is a curated children’s retail and community hub segmented into three complementary areas:
1. Retail Storefront
A carefully selected mix of children’s chapter books, picture books, vintage literature, and educational toys. The storefront is designed with a warm, whimsical atmosphere and interactive reading nooks that encourage children to linger and explore. We also provide a personalized gift-wrapping station, gift registries, and seasonal book bundles.
2. Event & Workshop Room
A flexible space for hosting birthday parties, author visits, storytimes, and educational workshops. The room can also be rented by homeschool co-ops or enrichment groups. Outfitted with comfortable seating and a cozy fireplace, the space is designed for gatherings of 8–25 people.
3. Book-Themed Play Basement
An indoor play zone that integrates imaginative play with literary exploration, offering climbable structures and themed playhouses. This space gives children a safe, screen-free way to engage physically and socially while deepening their love of stories.

Target Market
Lakewood has approximately 26,500 households, of which ~5,700 include children under 18. Our core customer base is these families, along with educators and community groups. Capturing just 20–25% of these households (~1,100–1,400 families) is sufficient to meet our Year 1 revenue goals.
We serve:
   * Parents of children ages 5–15 seeking screen-free learning and activities.

   * Homeschooling families and co-ops in need of community space and curriculum-supporting workshops.

   * Educators sourcing classroom books and enrichment materials.

   * Gift-givers looking for thoughtful, book-based presents.

   * Local families and book lovers seeking weekend activities, storytimes, and events.

________________


Revenue Streams
The Wandering Lantern’s diversified model blends retail sales with community programming:
1. Retail Sales (≈75% of Year 1 revenue, ~$115k)
      * Gently used and new curated books.
      * Educational toys, art supplies, and seasonal bundles.
      * Gift wrapping and registries.

2. Birthday Parties & Event Rentals (≈5% of Year 1 revenue, ~$7.7k)
         * Packages starting at $40/child (minimum 8 children).
         * Themed décor, craft activities, and storytime.
         * Optional upgrades: catering, gift registry, favors.

3. Workshops & Memberships (≈8% of Year 1 revenue, ~$12k)
            * Weekly or bi-weekly craft hours, readings, and clubs.
            * Membership options for homeschoolers and frequent visitors.
            * Curated book clubs and care package subscriptions.

4. Online Sales & Gift Registry (≈10% of Year 1 revenue, ~$15k)
               * Personalized book bundles and gift boxes.
               * Online birthday registry with QR code access.
               * Local pickup and national shipping.

Why This Model Works
By layering retail, events, memberships, and online sales, we diversify income and smooth seasonal swings. Families discover the store through events, then return for books, toys, and memberships. Educators and co-ops bring consistent weekday use, while gift registries and online bundles extend our reach beyond the store.
This blended model creates stability, leverages Lakewood’s 5,700 family households, and directly supports our conservative Year 1 projection of ~$150,000 in revenue.

Market Analysis
Industry Overview
The U.S. publishing industry generated $32.5 billion in 2024, with children’s/YA literature among the fastest-growing categories, up nearly 20% from 2020–2024. Independent bookstores have also experienced a resurgence, with hundreds of new stores opening since 2019 (American Booksellers Association). This growth reflects consumer demand for curated, local, and community-based experiences that online retailers cannot replicate.
Independent bookstores provide significant community value: 90% of their revenue recirculates locally, creating a 109% greater local economic impact than Barnes & Noble and a 405% advantage over Amazon (ABA). This local recirculation supports small business growth, school partnerships, and event programming, all of which align with The Wandering Lantern’s mission.
Market Trends Supporting the Concept
                  * Experience Economy: Families increasingly prioritize educational, screen-free experiences for children.

                  * Local Spending: Post-pandemic consumers are intentional about supporting local businesses.

                  * Indoor Activity Demand: Cleveland’s long winters drive demand for weather-independent children’s activities.

                  * Seasonality: Bookstores see up to 40–45% of sales during the holiday season, providing predictable surges.

                  * Education Investment: Lakewood’s high education levels (38% college graduates vs. 29% state average) correlate with strong book-buying behavior.

Local Market Demographics
Lakewood is a dense, family-oriented community:
                     * Population: ~50,900

                     * Households: ~26,500

                     * Households with children: ~5,700 (~6,300 children under 15)

                     * Median household income: $56,464

                     * Median age: 34.7 (younger than most Cleveland suburbs)

                     * Housing: 53% owner-occupied, indicating residential stability

Implication: Capturing just 20–25% of these family households (~1,100–1,400 families) is sufficient to achieve Year 1 revenue targets (~$150,000).
Target Customer Profile
                        * Primary Age Range: Children ages 5–15 and their parents

                        * Homeschooling families & co-ops seeking enrichment space and workshops

                        * Educators sourcing thoughtful classroom books and group programming

                        * Gift-givers seeking meaningful birthday/holiday options

                        * Local families seeking screen-free weekend and after-school activities

Competitive Landscape
Direct Competitors:
                           * Barnes & Noble (Crocker Park): Large chain bookstore ~15 minutes away; offers a substantial children’s section but relies on corporate programming and lacks dedicated play/event space.

                           * Loganberry Books (Shaker Heights): Well-known indie with curated inventory, but not children-exclusive and outside Lakewood’s trade area.

                           * Mac’s Backs (Cleveland Heights): Strong indie store with community programs, but broader focus and farther distance.

Indirect Competitors:
                              * Lakewood Public Library: Excellent free programming, but limited to younger children (<6) and not a retail model.

                              * Local play centers (Rocky River, Westlake): Provide birthday party/event venues at ~$40/child, but are activity-only, not integrated with book retail.

                              * Seasonal/Outdoor venues (parks, playgrounds): Attractive in summer but weather-dependent.

Market Gap Identified:
                                 * No dedicated children’s bookstore in Greater Cleveland.

                                 * Age-appropriate focus (5–15) fills the gap between preschool library programming and general indie stores.

                                 * Three-part experiential model (retail, events, play) not available locally.

                                 * Weather-independent destination attractive in long winters.

                                 * Curated local partnerships (schools, authors, co-ops) build loyalty.

Market Opportunity Analysis
According to Claritas data, the Lakewood retail market totals $423 million annually. Within this, the sporting goods, hobby, music, and book category represents a $3.9 million annual gap between local demand and available supply. Capturing even 0.1% of this spend (~$400k) represents a realistic growth path for The Wandering Lantern.
By contrast, our Year 1 projection of ~$150,000 in revenue reflects just 0.04% of the total retail market — a highly conservative assumption that demonstrates achievability.
Customer Validation
Conversations with Lakewood families and educators confirm demand for a dedicated children’s bookstore and enrichment space. Parents consistently expressed enthusiasm for weekly story hours, curated book clubs, and birthday party options. Regional bookstore operators also noted a lack of children-exclusive offerings in Cleveland’s west side, reinforcing this opportunity.

Operations Plan
Location & Facility
The Wandering Lantern will be located in Lakewood, Ohio, in a walkable neighborhood that aligns with our family-centric customer base. The store design includes:
                                                                     * Retail Storefront: curated book and toy displays, gift registry station, and interactive reading nooks.

                                                                     * Event Room: flexible space for storytimes, parties, workshops, and community events.

Buildout Phases are planned to control cash flow:
                                                                        * Phase 1 (Oct–Nov 2025): $50,000 investment for core buildout and furniture/fixtures.

                                                                        * Phase 2 (Jan–Feb 2026): $20,000 investment for play basement completion and event room upgrades.
This phased approach allows us to open on schedule while adding capacity over time.
